Node.js is Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

The V8 engine is a JavaScript engine that runs in google chrome with other chrome based web browsers.
It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute. 
When node is described as a JavaScript runtime it means that Node.js is a program in which can execute JS on our computers.
The current version of node on my terminal is v17.8.0
To Install a library package called 'jshint' i would use npm install -g jshint
Node.js is used to run JavaScript on the server.

We pair program for a multitude of reasons;
Greater efficiency
Engaged collaboration
Learning from fellow students
Social skills
Job interview readiness
Work environment readiness

I find pair programming to be beneficial because we're able to collaborate ideas and formulate new findings together,as well as build off one another's strength and weaknesses.
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
