SQL	NoSQL
 Databases called RDBMS	 databases called as non relational or distributed database
 SQL databases are table based databases	 Document based, key value pairs, graph databases or wide column stores.
 predefined schema	dynamic schema for unstructured data 
 vertically scalable	horizontally scalable 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Table based databases
Give a real world example.
SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Document based , key value pairs, graph databases or wide column stores.
Give a real world example.
NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
 NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose
Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. 


What does SQL stand for?

Structured query Language.
What is a relational database?
Means we have a database that works with certain assumptions, such as tables. i.e product tables. 
What type of structure does a relational database work with?
structured within data tables, views and indexes that are separate from the physical storage structures.
What is a ‘schema’?
A database schema is considered the blueprint in which how data is organized within a relational database. Which is inclusive of logical constraints such as table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities.
What is a NoSQL database?
They're non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.
How does it work?
They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
What is inside of a Mongo database?
MongoDB stores data records as documents. 
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
There is no clear winner, it is dependent on user preference. For a fast growing start up in need of flexibility and scalability NoSQL is better, but if you're more focused on data integrity and consistency SQL is a better approach.
