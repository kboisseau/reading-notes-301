Roy fielding is an individual who helped pave the way for modern day web servers. He wrote the first web server that was able to send documents across the internet.

Because web pages are designed to be understood by people. A machine doesn't care about layout and styling. Machines basically just need the data. 

HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

GET uses the HTTP protocol until all resources are obtained and the web page is displayed.

POST is used when one system needs to add something to another system.

PUT is used when a system wants to replace something in another system.

Patch is used for  a partial update.
